# A BERT-Based Deep Learning Approach for Identification of Intrinsically Disordered Region in Proteins

The identification of IDRs has gained significant momentum due to the discovery of their vital role in numerous cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions Post-Translational Modification, and phase separations. Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs) are pivotal to understanding protein functionality in cellular processes, with
significant implications in drug discovery and structural biology. 

Accurately identifying these regions can be groundbreaking for understanding the functions of proteins in cellular processes. The traditional methods for experimentally characterizing IDRs are Time-consuming and costly, While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques sometimes require improved scalability and accuracy for diverse, large datasets, the development of advanced language models addresses these needs.

Our approach is a BERT-based deep learning model to accurately predict the location of intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) in protein sequences to understand the role of IDRs in cellular functions.
